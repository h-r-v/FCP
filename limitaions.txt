1. for loop works only for 1 variable.
2. for loop only works with a paticular syntax: <itteration_variable>,<initialization_value>,<termination_condition>,<increament_value>
code: for <itteration_variable> in range(<initialization_value>,<termination_condition>,<increament_value>):
3. Loops always need to be connected to their scope first. What ever thier 1st edge is pointing to is considered as their scope.
4. Cannot put any commas or special characters while using "print" and "input" keywords.
5. Never use "input" keyword when planning to use the "Execute feature"
